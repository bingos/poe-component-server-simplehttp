=head1 ABSTRACT

	Subclass of SimpleHTTP for PreForking support

=head1 New Constructor Options

=over 5

=item C<MINSPARESERVERS>

	An integer that tells the server how many spares should be in the pool at any given
	time. Processes are forked off at a rate of 1 a second until this limit is met.

=item C<MAXSPARESERVERS>

	An integer that tells the server the maximum number of spares that may be in the pool
	at any given time. It is possible for more than this number of spares to exist, but at the very
	least the parent will stop forking requests off and the children will start to die eventually.

	If this value is less than MINSPARESERVERS then it is set to MINSPARESERVERS + 1.

=item C<MAXCLIENTS>

	An integer that tells the server the maximum number of clients that will be
	created. After this limit is reached, no more spares will be forked, even if the number drops below
	MINSPARESERVERS.

=item C<STARTSERVERS>

	An integer that tells the server how many processes to prefork at startup.

=item C<FORKHANDLERS>

	A HASH where the keys are sessions and the values are events. When a child forks,
	before it begins accepting connections it will call these events on the specified
	sessions. This allows you to setup per-process resources (such as database
	connections, ldap connects, etc). These events will never be called for the
	parent.

=back

=head2 New Events

=over 4

=item C<ISCHILD>

	Returns true if you are inside a child, false if you are in the parent.

=item C<GETFORKHANDLERS>

	This event accepts 2 arguments: the session + event to send the response to.

	This even will send back the current FORKHANDLERS hash ( deep-closed via
	Storable::dclone ).

	The resulting hash can be played around to your tastes, then once you are done...

=item C<SETFORKHANDLERS>

	This event accepts only one argument: reference to FORKHANDLERS hash.

	BEWARE: this event is disabled in a forked child.

=back

=head1 Miscellaneous Notes

	BEWARE: HANDLERS munging is disabled in a forked child. Also, handlers changed in
	the parent will not appear in the already forked children.

	BEWARE: for a child, calling {STOP,START}LISTEN does not {destroy,recreate} the
	SOCKETFACTORY like it does in the parent. Instead, the child will {pause,resume}
	accepting connections on the current SOCKETFACTORY. Also, {STOP,START}LISTEN does
	not have any effect on the scoreboard calculations: this child will still
	be marked a spare if it finishes all its requests.

	The shutdown event is altered a little bit
		GRACEFUL -> sends a TERM signal to all remaining children and waits for their death
		NOARGS -> kills all remaining children with prejudice

	Keep in mind that being forked means any global data is not shared between processes and etc. Please see perlfork for all the implications on your platform.

=head1 New Compile-time constants

Checking spares every second may be a bit too much for you.
You can override this behavior by doing this:

	sub POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork::CHECKSPARES_INTERVAL () { 10 }
	use POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork;

If the prefork failed because it could not obtain shared memory for the scoreboard,
then if retries after 5 seconds. You can override this behavior by doing this:

	sub POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork::PREFORK_INTERVAL () { 10 }
	use POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork;

If you would like to see the contents of the scoreboard every second then do this:

	sub POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork::DEBUGSB () { 1 }
	use POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP::PreFork;

=head2 EXPORT

Nothing.
