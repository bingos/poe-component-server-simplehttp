- look if ADDRESS stuff is really unnecesary because that makes impossible to bind to certain ip
 (it might be optional but possible to give)
- Support for ucfirst lc $arguments not only uppercase ones? (or check if that works in all cases)

- indents in everywhere and one coding style (which one?)

- cleanup logging methods, currently:
 * LOGHANDLER is fired on request (which place could be used for ACLs not loggers)
 * LOG2HANDLER is fired after servicing request BUT NOT for Streams (need to be fixed)

- maybe after first fail for any session/event post that handler should be disabled? 
  or maybe triggerable behaviour

any other ideas?
